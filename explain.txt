With our first test cases, we have a coverage of about 60%.
To increase out coverage we implemented three new scenarios.
The scenarios concern the Odroid, we mock the Odroid to simulate recieving data from it.

After this implementation our coverage went up over 20% (see picture).
(These scenarios are in the class "MainTest.java", and the code-snippet is from the class "ReadUserInput.java").
